# Getting Started
### 1. Join the Discord
We have a Discord server for recieving notifications during the hackathon and communicating with your team, mentors, and event organizers. You can join through the following link:

https://discord.gg/rJwX4vw3

### 2. Choose a team name
Choose wisely. Send a direct message to Cameron on Discord once you and your team have decided.

### 3. Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have one, be sure to create a GitHub account. You can use any email you prefer and feel free to personalize your account as much as you like. This is the first step to participating in open-source collaboration and will serve to showcase your contributions to future software projects! 

### 4. Create a GitHub Repository
Create a repository to maintain develop of your project and collaborate with your team. You can follow a tutorial on how to create a GitHub [here.](https://github.com/signup) You may want to make the repository private during the competition, however please ensure that the repository is made public before presenting on Sunday. If you do choose to make the repository private, you will have to add collaborators so that they can contribute.

### 5. Add a README.md
Documentation is esential for any successful software project.

### 6. Choose a license
Open source projects require an appropriate liscense that informs useage and protects the intellectual property of contributors. Learn how to add a liscense [here.](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository) If you need help picking a liscense, [this guide may help.](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/)

### 7. Clone the repository
Clone the new repository to either your local computer or a server. You can learn how to clone repositories and interact with `git` using [these tutorials.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

### 8. Git commands
Learn how to use `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git pull`, and `git push` for basic version control. You may want to start by making simple README modifications or adding text files. You may also want to learn how to "fork" repositories, "make branches", make "pull requests", and "merge branches" for easier collaboration with your team.

### 9. Hack!
Start developing your project. A few tips:
1. Practice making frequent, small commits. This will make it easier to track versions and merge if you have multiple branches.
2. Incorporate basic documentation through code comments and commit messages to make polishing future documentation easier.
3. Have fun and don't be afraid to tinker!

### 10. Final Product
See the guidelines below for what objectives your team should aim to complete and how your team will be judged.

# Judging Objectives and Guidelines
The goals for this hackathon are as follows:
1. Explore how to become a contributor to open-source geoscience projects
2. Learn the requirements and implications of computational reproduciability, as defined by the [Geoscience Papers of the Future Initiative](https://www.ontosoft.org/gpf.html).
3. Gain experience with building open-source software and communicating your work

All teams are expected to produce a GitHub Repository with the following objectives:
- An active commit history that showcases contributions from all team members
- An open-source license
- Standalone code using publicly available datasets and packages
- A README.md file with basic documentation and instructions on how to reproduce results using the repository
- A final presentation showcasing the repository, summarizing the project, and analyzing any challenges the team faced.

Each team will be judged on the following characteristics:
- Success in completing the objectives listed above
- Quality of the README.md and other documentation
- Ease of use and code readability
- Active participation from all team members
- Effectiveness and enthusiasm of final presentation
